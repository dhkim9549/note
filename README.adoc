=== Note ===
It is extremely difficult to beat an index.
Unless you include a super star stock in your portfolio, you won't be able to keep the pace with an index.

You might be able to beat an index if you are very lucky or very talented. But at what cost?

You might as well just buy an index fund, and move on to your real life. If you do, you will no longer have to worry about when to sell, what to sell, when to buy, and what to buy, and live your real life.

Life is like an index fund.
You keep doing things, and most of those will end without any significant results.

However, once in a while, things will take off and become super stars.
In the seemingly mundane life portfolio of yours, there is a huge jack pot waiting to happen.

Bezos says `Double the number of experiments, double the inventiveness.`

====== The conclusion is... ======

`Fail Fast.` Keep doing it. Keep exploring ideas. Life is full of surprises.

Just Do It.
