=== Note ===
It is extremely difficult to beat an index.
Unless you include a super star stock in your portfolio, you won't be able to keep the pace with an index.

You might be able to beat an index if you are very luck or very talented. But at what cost?

You might as well just buy and index fund, and move on to your real life. If you do, you no longer have to worry about when to sell, what to sell, when to buy, and what to buy, and live your real life.
